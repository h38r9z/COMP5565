COMP5565   Decentralized   Apps   Fundamentals   and   Development
Group Project (25%)
Form   a   group   of   five   students.   Nominate   a   group   leader.   Enroll   in   one   of   the   groups   in   Blackboard by   1st November 2024.
BackgroundThe   project   will   focus   on   creating   a   dApp   on   either   Ethereum,   which   would   be   public   and   permissionless,   or   Hyperledger   Fabric,   a private   and permissioned blockchain,   depending   on   the   chosen   privacy   requirements.   The   dApp   will   enable   a   luxury   jewelry   maker   to   create   digital   certificates   of   authenticity   for   each   item   made   of   diamond   they   produce,   which   can   be transferred to the buyer along with the   physical   product.   Consumers   will   be   able   to   verify   the product’s authenticity by checking the certificate on the blockchain.
What you have to   doThe main objective is to design and develop a user-friendly dApp that interacts with a   blockchain to   ensure the traceability   and   authenticity   of luxury   goods.   In this project,   choose ONE   of   the   two   blockchains   (Ethereum   OR   Hyperledger   Fabric).
The dApp   should:
1.       Provide a transparent audit trail for the life cycle   of   each   luxury   item,   including:
a.       mining the diamond (by   mining   company)
b.       cutting and polishing (by cutting   company)
c.       controlling quality and laser engraving   of   unique   ID   (by   grading   lab)
d.       entering   possession   of   the   jewelry   maker
e.       designing and inlaying the   diamond   into   a   jewelry
f.         customer purchasing the   jewelry or transferring ownership.
2.       Allow manufacturers to issue and transfer digital certificates tied to unique ID.
3.       Enable consumers to verify the authenticity of   their purchases easily via   a   front   end.
4.       Ensure   the   security, transparency, and   privacy   of   the   system.
To this   end:
1.       Outline   the   architecture   of   the   dApp,   including smart   contracts,   user   interfaces,   and   database design.      Note that you will likely ne代 写COMP5565 Decentralized Apps Fundamentals and Development 2024/25 Semester 1

2.       Implement   your    solution   according   to   your   architecture.   Ensure   smart   contracts   are   secure and optimized for gas usage (if   Ethereum   is   chosen).
3.       Develop the frontend to interact with the blockchain, directly or via a centralized   backend.
4.       Deploy   smart   contracts   on   a   local   Ethereum   blockchain   (Hardhat)   or   set   up   a   network   (Hyperledger   Fabric).
Part   1: System Design (40   marks)Write   a   report   to   provide   details   of   the   design   of   your      system.   Elaborate   clearly    (1)   the   security,   (2)   the   accessibility   of information   and   (3)   the   efficiency   of your   implementation   (Part 2). Justify critically your   solution.
Part 2: System Implementation (40   marks)Implement   the system    based on your design in   Part   1. The system should use either   blockchain frameworks, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. For the front-end of your   applications,   it   can   be desktop software    (GUI/Terminal-based), mobile app,   website    or   a   combination   of   them.
In the same report in Part   1, include a detailed   system   installation   guide.
Part 3: Presentation (20 marks)You are   going   to   give a 10-minute    presentation on your   project on 28    November    2024   (Thur) in the last lecture   session.   The presentation   should   include   the   design   of   your   system.   It can also include a brief (<4min) demonstration   of your systems which    have been   implemented already at the time of   presentation. The presentation   schedule will be   announced once the group formation is confirmed. The presentation is to be held physically   on   campus.
RemarksYour   report   must   NOT   exceed   30   pages,   excluding   the   cover   page,   including   the   table   of   contents and appendices of supplementary documents (e.g., diagrams,   figures, and   screenshots), with single   line   spacing   and   font   size 12. Use   PDF   for the report   only. Use   the   APA or IEEE standard to   format all   citations.
